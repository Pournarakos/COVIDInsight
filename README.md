# **Data Mining and Machine Learning: COVID-19 Data Analysis**

## **Overview**
This project analyzes global COVID-19 data to uncover patterns, classify countries by performance, and predict positivity rates using machine learning models.

### **Key Goals**
1. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and correlations.
2. Classify countries into clusters based on their COVID-19 performance metrics.
3. Predict positivity rates in Greece using RNN and SVM regression models.
